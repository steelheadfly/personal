# Taxes and Rents

The 1970s turn to neoliberal economics gave us a new normal: Record profits year on year with lion share reinvested in the already existing rentable assets inflating their price way beyond the realm of wage earners reach. And with that ever increasing value, rents galore.

When one looks at the throughline on just how much of the total volume of all transactions go the various kinds of rents (dividends, interest on loans, real estate, privatised infrastructure, land, insurance), it's right to begin shifting the burden of taxation back on capital gains to fund projects for the commons.

Georgism (and economics before the 1970s) defines the free market as free from/of rent. When money exchanges hands and that exchange produces something, or just at the very least maintains an existing one leads to abundance of actual wealth in the form of products and services and maintained assets. It's opposite is capital gains on rent, where nothing changes in the real world, just money is transferred from one bank account to another.

### Competetiveness

The biggest metric of competitiveness has always been wages. Because in a market system, this is the only real lever that corporates can pull on to economise with. They can try to haggle from a client's position about opreating costs, but the real power of price setting resides with the vendor, not the client.

There is a pressure for higher wages now with the inflation but the problem is that we live in the global economy and much of what's in the products price is set principally by the cost of rents we have to pay in order to make ends meet. We can't possibly become price competitive globally without chaining rents again, like we did after the second world war.

I'm currently living in China and it's just unbelieveable how little everything costs. How can you price-compete with a country where the total cost of living is at around a fifth compared to the west? And it's all about cheap rents showing it's effect through the value chain.

### Finland

The lowest possible marginal tax rate in my country is around 8% for which the take home pay caps at 1074e/month. The cheapest studio/single bed flat you can get around the tri-city area central enough for decent commute starts somewhere around 700e/month and growing up fast year on year. On top of that the transportation fee is around 100e/month. Then water, electricity, phone, and internet adds another 200e/m.

This means that low income workers (part time, gig econ) have at worst 90% of their net pay going into rents where the taxable income is just 8%. Above 18000/year the marginal tax rate jumps to 34.5% in a country where capital gains taxes cap at 34%. It's an utter disgrace.

It's no surprise that we're now seeing a massive wave of bankruptcies and unemployment and some things that we thought we had solved like homelessness and the usage of food banks is back and on the rise.

### Adaptive taxation

In software engineering one of the more common features we are putting everywhere nowadays is some kind of a load balancer. The idea is to have a dynamic threshold of demand that once reached the system changes its rules of prioritisation.

One such idea for taxation would to monitor the total transaction volume in our economy and how of a big percentage of that volume goes into rents and begins to adjust capital gains taxes higher as the share of rent-seeking goes up.

Another would be to anchor progressive income tax to median annual income. This way during downturns when the median annual income drops, the burden of taxation shifts towards high earners and capital gains to cushion against the shock and to disincentivise mass layoffs.

This preassumes some kind of EU-lead effort in setting the guidelines and enforcing them as a prerequisite of participating in the common market, but in some cases this could also be done just individually by each country, as the rentable assets are often physically impossible to move to another country in order to avoid taxes and people have families and other ties to their home country and don't move out so easily anyways.

#### Some concrete examples (with handwavy numbers)

- Move the tax collection date to April (reporting date remains the same) of the following year to have time to account for median annual income and rents share of total transactions volume in the economy.

- Set the income threshold for VAT liability to a function of annual median income with a 1.4 multiplier. Currently the median annual income is around 39600e, so the VAT treshhold would be 55440e. Only charge VAT from revenue above the threshold. Sole traders are not big business and should not be treated as such and much of this income is already taxed through progressive income taxation.

- Add a threshold for income for corporate taxes as a function of median annual household income with a multiplier of 5. This would go a long way helping small family businesses. I also think that there should be some kind of buffer based on median annual income and the size of the corporations workforce that they can hold in cash before being liable to corporation taxes. We want corporations with resilience to shocks, instead of on govt bailouts. We also dont want to see mass layoffs the second we hit a technical recession.

- Increase the progression curve drastically on capital gains taxes (from 30% to 70%) as a function of economic rents share of total volume of all transactions. As the share of rent seeking in the economy goes down, so does top end of capital gains taxes. All of this is to incentivise investing in new assets, not just rent seeking with the existing ones.

- Progressive tax brackets all as function of median annual income (MAI). This would ensure that during a downturn when MAI drops the burden of taxation is automatically adjusted towards capital gains and high earners.
